# Wrap files are YAML files which are stored in plugins/HMCWraps/wraps/ and contain wraps for easy drag & drop
# operations. These can be nested up to 10 folders deep, so you can sort them by folder too.
# The file name doesn't matter, the plugin loads everything in the above-mentioned folder.

# If this particular file is enabled
enabled: true
# All the wraps in this file
# The configuration is exactly the same as in config.yml
